MuDirac is a simulation software that integrates the Dirac equation for muonic atoms to compute their X-Ray transition energies; it is written in C++ and can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/muon-spectroscopy-computational-project/mudirac>`_. The use and functioning of MuDirac 1.0 is extensively documented in the paper `S. Sturniolo, A. Hillier, "Mudirac: A Dirac equation solver for elemental analysis with muonic X-rays", X-Ray Spectrom. 2020;1–17 <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/xrs.3212>`_, which should be cited by any work using it. Here we will give a quick tutorial on how to start using it for simple cases.
